1.In Interface, a class can implement multiple interfaces, whereas the class can inherit only one Abstract Class.
2.In Interface does not have access modifiers. 
3.Everything defined inside the Interface is assumed to have a public modifier, 
  whereas Abstract Class can have an access modifier.
4.The Interface cannot contain data fields, whereas the abstract class can have data fields.
5.Abstract keyword used to declare the abstract class. 
  Also, the abstract class can be extended by using the keyword “extends”.
6.Interface keyword used to declare interface. Also, 
  interface can be implemented by using the keyword “implements”.
7.Can have abstract and non-abstract methods. Can have default method implementation
8.Can only have abstract methods, though, since Java 8, it can also have static and default methods. 
9.With Abstract class we can Achieve (0-90)% abstraction,whereas with interface we we can Achieve (100)% abstraction.
10.Abstract class Can have final, non-final, static, and non-static variables.
11.Interface Can only have final and static variables.
